# dp-compose
A project to assist in composing multiple DP services

Running dp-compose assumes Docker is running natively and not in a VM. On a Mac this requires Docker for mac - NOT the previous docker toolbox which runs docker in a VM.

Run ```docker-compose up``` to create docker containers for all required backing services. Using the ``` ./run.sh ``` script does the same thing.
