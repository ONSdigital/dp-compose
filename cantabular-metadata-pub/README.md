# RTT Metadata devstack

For historic reasons documentation for running this devstack is in

https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-cantabular-metadata-extractor-api/blob/develop/devstack/README.md

In short use the `scs-md.sh` script there after carefully reading those docs.
This is not an easy system to setup you will need patience and time. Good luck!
